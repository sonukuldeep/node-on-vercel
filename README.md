# 10$ website collection

This project uses nodejs, passportjs, tailwindcss, node mailer, postgress db, etc, under the hood.

Essentially, this is a collection of websites I'll be offering to my clients as a cheaper alternative to react and next js websites that I develop and sell.

This serves as a template for rapid development and delivery to websites.

If you are thinking of cloning or forking this project please consider supporting my hard work by give a start to this repo. 

The website is deployed [here](https://10-dollar-website.vercel.app/).
